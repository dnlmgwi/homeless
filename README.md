# homeless

The Idea we co-designed with the youth in Walvis Bay, aimed to sensitize the community towards the homeless living with in the Walvis Bay area. They had identified that there was a large number of homeless people and that they faced a lot of problems with regards to living area, and access to the basic needs of any human being.
